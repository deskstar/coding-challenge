Hello, my name is Johnny, thank you for reviewing this piece of work, all of my deliverables are inside folder JsonProject.

Here are some instructions


Using Docker (Recommend)

Prerequisites Docker Desktop (Windows) 2.3.05 or above
(Didn't test on Mac/ Linux, but suppose they should work too)

1. Open your command prompt in \JsonProject (as the Dockerfile inside)

2. ***Build Docker Image***
docker image build -t docker-9spokes-json-challenge .

3. ***Run the program (inside the docker) to read the JSON and do the calculation***
docker run -v <Your JSON file path>:/build/target/data.json docker-9spokes-json-challenge data.json

For example, my JSON file located in C:\docker\sampleData.json, so the command would be:
docker run -v C:\docker\sampleData.json:/build/target/data.json docker-9spokes-json-challenge data.json

***Run the program with the default JSON file provided by 9Spokes in github***
docker run docker-9spokes-json-challenge 

4. ***Unit test will be running automatically when building the image***


Using Maven 

Prerequisites Java 8 and Maven 3
(Tested with Maven 3.6, but suppose most maven version would work, unless very old)

1. Open your command prompt in \JsonProject (as the pom.xml inside)

2. Run the unit test
mvn test 

3. Compile and package to an executable jar
mvn clean compile assembly:single

4. Execute the program, provided the JSON file path as argument
java -jar target/JsonProject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar sampleData.json

if you provide the JSON file with absolute path, and your path contains space, 
please replace the space with '%20' or just put the JSON file inside the \JsonProject

For example
C:\Users\Johnny Lai\sampleData.json replace the space and become
C:\Users\Johnny%20Lai\sampleData.json
